# Efficient Computation of (2^n,2^n)-isogenies

This is the Sage/Magma code accompanying the paper

> S. Kunzweiler, Efficient Computation of (2^n,2^n)-Isogenies, Preprint, 2022

We provide an implementation of the algorithm described in that article and various examples. 
Furthermore, the repository contains code that can be used to verify the formulas developed in the manuscript.
